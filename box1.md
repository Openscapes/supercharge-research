# A ten-week plan for open data science

Here are suggestions for ten weekly meetings to reshape your research group’s perspective. These meetings should be encouraged by the team leader, but they don’t necessarily have to attend. Activities can span multiple weeks and are to be revisited as needed (for example, when new members join). Note that resources are R focused, but remain illustrative of good theory and practice no matter the coding language.

## Week 1: What does a team workflow using open data science look like? What does the transition look like?

**Long-term goals**: Transition into open data science incrementally, and involve peer-to-peer learning and online communities.

**Read**: [Lowndes, J. S. S. et al. Nature Ecol. Evol. 1, 0160 (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160).

**Discuss**: How do we approach reproducibility, collaboration and communication?

## Week 2: How do we store and share our data, methods and code?

Long-term goals: Have clear systems for data management, storage and backup, as well as for documentation of methods and code.

Read: Wilson, G. et al. PLoS Comput. Biol. 13, e1005510 (2017).

Discuss: What are our data-management systems?

## Week 3: What are our values? How do we build trust and facilitate collaboration?

Long-term goals: Set the tone for a positive, inclusive culture.

Read: Nature 557, 293 (2018). Also, read Notes on our lab Code of Conduct and Write or Choose a Code of Conduct.

Discuss: How do these topics align with our values?

Task: Create a code of conduct or working agreement.

## Week 4: How do we streamline other aspects of our research, such as presentations and teaching?

Long-term goals: Create a culture of sharing text (for example, manuscripts and proposals), photos, posters and presentations.

Discuss: What are we comfortable sharing with each other? How can we streamline organization and sharing of files?

Task: Create and organize a Google Drive for the group. Explore Google Slides and Drawings.

## Week 5: How do I collaborate easily with people who are remote or in different time zones?

Long-term goals: Reduce barriers to remote participation, and enable asynchronous collaboration..

Read: GitHub for Project Management.

Discuss: What programs do we use, and what accounts does our institution have?

Task: Explore software options for video conferencing, group chat and project management, such as Zoom, Slack and GitHub.

## Week 6: Which version of my code was I using, and where is it?

Long-term goals: Use collaborative versioning software, and think ahead for ‘future you’ and ‘future us’.

Read: Bryan, J. Am. Stat. 72, 20–27 (2017). Also, read Fishbowl Chat #1.

Discuss: How can we help the whole group to use version control collaboratively?

## Week 7: I can’t understand or run other group members’ code.

Long-term goals: Adopt shared practices so that it’s easier to collaborate using code.

Read: Bryan, J. & Hester, J. What They Forgot to Teach You About R Ch. 1–4 (2019). Also, read Ross, Z., Wickham, H. & Robinson, D. Preprint at PeerJ Preprints https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.3180v1 (2017).

Discuss: How do we organize files, code and projects? Could we adopt shared conventions?

## Week 8: How do we record and organize data to streamline analyses?

Long-term goals: Promote good data-entry etiquette and keep raw data separate from analyses.

Read: Broman, K. W. & Woo, K. H. Am. Stat. 72, 2–10 (2017).

Discuss: Do we keep raw data raw and recorded with future analyses in mind?

## Week 9: How do we help new group members to learn how we work, and how do we retain continuity when people leave?

Long-term goals: Create a strategy for onboarding and offboarding members that promotes openness and inclusion.

Read: How we work: Onboarding.

Discuss: What would help to onboard new group members?

Task: Create and share a document outlining the onboarding and offboarding processes for your group.

## Week 10: How do we continue learning and improving how we work together?

Long-term goals: Create a shared vision for future meetings so they provide a mix of skill development and team building.

Discuss: How can we set topics, and how do we rotate who leads?

Task: Identify learning opportunities (for example, rOpenSci, R-Ladies or The Carpentries). Work out what allies you have at your institution (such as data librarians or coding clubs).
