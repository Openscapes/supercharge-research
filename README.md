# Welcome!


If you are here you have probably read [Supercharge your research: A 10-week plan for open data science](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03335-4) and might have ideas for what alternate topic list look like, or one for the following 10 weeks. 

We'd love to hear your ideas and what youâ€™d add to the list! 

It's probably easiest to post an Issue about it, but if you'd like to submit a pull request that would be great too! 

Thanks!
